When you get your first software engineering role everything can seem daunting and scary, and you don't know what is the best approach to use to make significant progress and become a better engineer. This is a useful approach that you can try to follow:

1. Pick up a ticket (a task) and try to understand the problem that you are asked to solve.

2. Explain your understanding of the ticket to someone more senior than you. That’s going to reinforce your understanding of it, and your senior engineer is going to point out what you understand correctly and what you don’t

3. Schedule 3 sessions of pair programming per week to discuss the ticket. Tell your engineer about your attempts so that he knows that you tried on your own.

4. Write code! It might be daunting in the beginning (I was definitely feeling like that!), but if you do want to get better at coding, get into the habit of writing code daily. You will make mistakes but you’ll also improve.

5. Be excited and proud of what you’re doing, you got this! :D
