## Choose experience over salary
When you graduate you dream about earning a great salary because you’ve been grinding throughout  university, and now you want to earn better money. However, first you work for experience, and then you let experience work for you. A company might offer you a lower salary but a great learning experience, which is what you need when you're first out of university. 
## Stick with one language and framework
Pick whatever language you like and stick with it for sometime. You will learn more languages as the time goes by, but my point is that there is no point in learning multiple languages and frameworks just to make your CV look fuller (or “experienced”). 
## Work on your communication skills
Software engineering involves a lot of communication with technical and non-technical stuff. Sometimes you will have to communicate with people who might not have a technical background. The ability to articulate technicalities so that everyone regardless of the background can understand will make you stand out from many developers.
