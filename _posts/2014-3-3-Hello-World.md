## Choose experience over salary
### I understand that when you graduate you dream about earning big money because you’ve been grinding throughout university, and now you want to earn better money. However, first you work for experience, and then experience will work in your favour in the future. 

## Stick with one language and framework
### Pick whatever language you like and stick with it for sometime. You will learn more languages as the time goes by, but my point is that there is no point in learning multiple languages and frameworks just to make your CV look fuller (or “experienced”).
